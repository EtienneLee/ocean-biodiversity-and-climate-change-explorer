# Ocean Biodiversity & Climate Change Explorer ðŸŒŠ

## Overview

The Ocean Biodiversity & Climate Change Explorer is an interactive platform designed to explore marine biodiversity and ocean conditions by integrating data from the World Ocean Database (WOD) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). This application provides researchers and interested users with tools to investigate marine life and ocean characteristics across different locations, utilizing ocean temperature, salinity, and species occurrence data.

**Key Technologies:** React.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS)

## Project Status

Please note that the PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS has been decommissioned due to cost considerations. While the live application is no longer available, a demo video and comprehensive project documentation are provided below for review.

## Individual Contributions

This project was completed by a team of four individuals. The following highlights my specific contributions to the project (details in documentation):

*   **OBIS Data Preprocessing and Loading:** Preprocessed and loaded the OBIS dataset into AWS.
*   **Database Normalization and Optimization:** Led database normalization and implemented key optimizations on WOD and OBIS datasets
*   **Advanced Queries and API Development:** Developed two advanced queries/API endpoints for the species page: advanced species search with multiple filters and species card information retrieval.
*   **Frontend Development (Species Page):** Designed and implemented frontend components for the advanced species search feature, including a paginated table and species card modal.
*   **Documentation:** Wrote most of the documentation, including the data preprocessing and loading section, ER diagram, and table details.
