# Ocean Biodiversity & Climate Change Explorer ðŸŒŠ

## Overview
Our project combines data from the World Ocean Database (WOD) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) to create an interactive platform for exploring marine biodiversity and ocean conditions. The application integrates ocean temperature, salinity, and species occurrence data to provide researchers and interested users with tools to explore marine life and ocean characteristics across different locations.
